<div>Reservoir computing exploits high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics to solve temporal prediction tasks with minimal training cost. We investigate<b> Topological Quantum Reservoir Computing (TQRC)</b>, which proposes to harness the braiding dynamics of <b>non-Abelian Fibonacci Anyons</b> as <b>Quantum Reservoirs</b>. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension: the very properties that make topological systems attractive for quantum computation (unitary evolution and information preservation) fundamentally oppose the&nbsp;<b>Echo State Property (ESP)</b> required for reservoir computing. We demonstrate rigorously that pure unitary TQRC violates the ESP: unitary evolution preserves distances in Hilbert space, preventing the fading memory necessary for reservoir computing. On&nbsp;<b>Mackey-Glass time series benchmarks</b>, pure unitary TQRC achieves&nbsp;<b>NRMSE ≈ 1.0 (equivalent to random guessing)</b>. Introducing controlled dissipation with enhanced complex amplitude readout achieves best NRMSE = 0.44, but at the cost of sacrificing topological protection. Comparison against classical ESN baseline reveals a&nbsp;<b>20× performance gap</b> at equivalent state-space dimension (<b>ESN NRMSE = 0.02 vs. TQRC NRMSE = 0.44 for d = 13, Cohen’s d &gt; 200, p &lt; 10−65</b>), quantifying the practical cost of&nbsp;<b>Echo State Property (ESP)</b> violation. We identify four structural causes:&nbsp;</div><ol><li><b>probability readout constrains states to the simplex, </b></li><li><b>measurement destroys phase information, </b></li><li><b>| · |2 provides weaker nonlinearity than tanh, and </b></li><li><b>structured braid matrices limit state-space utilization.</b> </li></ol><div>These results constitute a no-go theorem for topological quantum reservoir computing on chaotic prediction tasks: topological protection and reservoir computing functionality represent fundamentally competing requirements. Notably, TQRC performs comparably to ESN on <b>memory-focused tasks (NARMA-10)</b>, suggesting task-dependent applicability. This finding provides essential guidance for the quantum machine learning community, establishing that topological protection should not be pursued as a route to quantum reservoir computing advantage for chaotic time series prediction.&nbsp;</div><div><b>Index Terms—Topological quantum computing, Fibonacci anyons, reservoir computing, echo state property, quantum machine learning, negative results</b></div>
