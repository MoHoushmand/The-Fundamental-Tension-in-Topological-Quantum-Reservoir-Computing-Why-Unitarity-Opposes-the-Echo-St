<div>Reservoir computing exploits high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics to solve temporal prediction tasks with minimal training cost. We investigate <b>Topological Quantum Reservoir Computing (TQRC)</b>, which proposes to harness the braiding dynamics of Fibonacci anyons as quantum reservoirs. Our comprehensive analysis reveals a<b> fundamental tension:</b> the very properties that make topological systems attractive for quantum computation (unitary evolution and information preservation) fundamentally oppose the Echo State Property (ESP) required for reservoir computing.&nbsp;</div><div>We demonstrate rigorously that <b>pure unitary TQRC violates the ESP:</b> unitary evolution preserves distances in Hilbert space, preventing the fading memory necessary for reservoir computing. On Mackey-Glass time series benchmarks, pure unitary TQRC achieves <b>NRMSE ≈ 1.0</b> (equivalent to random guessing). Introducing controlled dissipation recovers functional reservoir dynamics (best NRMSE = 0.44), but at the cost of sacrificing topological protection. Critically, we show that <b>classical Echo State Networks outperform dissipative TQRC by 20×</b> at equivalent state-space dimension (<b>ESN NRMSE = 0.02 vs. TQRC NRMSE = 0.44 for d = 13</b>).&nbsp;</div><div>We identify four root causes:&nbsp;</div><ol><li> probability readout constrains states to the simplex,&nbsp;</li><li>measurement destroys phase information,&nbsp;</li><li><b>| • | 2</b> provides weaker nonlinearity than tanh, and</li><li>structured braid matrices limit state-space utilization.&nbsp;</li></ol><div>These results constitute a <b>no-go theorem</b> for topological quantum reservoir computing: topological protection and reservoir computing functionality represent fundamentally competing requirements. This finding provides essential guidance for the quantum machine learning community, establishing that topological protection should not be pursued as a route to quantum reservoir computing advantage.</div><div>Index Terms—Topological Quantum Computing, Fibonacci Anyons, QuantumReservoir</div>
